# Project Proposal
The project our team is planning on developing is a pancake plotter. This system uses a 2.5 axis CNC system to interpret code and plot the batter on a griddle. 
The batter is contained in a 500 mL syringe which is moved along a radial arm via a motor belt system. The raidial arm is mounted to a second motor
which can rotate from -90 to 90 degrees. To reduce the amount of stress on the second motor, a semi-circle will be used to support the end of the radial 
arm. We plan to fabricate the entire system by using 80/20 1" tubing as the structure, using a gridle as a bed, using 3D-printed parts as mount, and
using laser-cut plywood for the semi-circular support. Sketches and a gif of our system design can be seen in the figures below.
