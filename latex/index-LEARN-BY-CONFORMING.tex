This section will cover the tasks that we plan on utilizing for our 2.\+5 axis machine. The main taks that we will need include a G-\/\+Code task thatconverts G-\/code into usable coordinates, a radial motor task, a transverse motor task, and a syringe motor task. The task diagram below shows how we plan on implimenting these tasks into our design through the use of queue and share objects. each task will be discussed more i depth in the following sections.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysubsection{Include picture of task diagram}\label{index_autotoc_md0}
\hypertarget{index_G-CODE}{}\doxysubsection{TASK}\label{index_G-CODE}
The G-\/\+Code task will be responsible for the conversion a G-\/\+Code into coordinates that can be used by our machine. This will be accomplished by first converting the G-\/\+Code file into cartesian coordinates through the use of splicing and appending. These will then be converted to polar coordinates using conversion formulas. The radial and transverese coordinates will then be split into seperate quees and then sent off to the appropiaate motor task.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{FSM?}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
\hypertarget{index_RADIAL}{}\doxysubsection{MOTOR TASK}\label{index_RADIAL}
The radial motor task will be responsible for the radial motion of our nozzle. This task will function by taking the radial coordinates from the G-\/\+Code task and using these values as refernece point for a controller object. The output of the controller will then be used to apply a duty cycle to the radial motor. Since we will be utilizing the encoder to measure position, it will be important to convert the rotational motion of the encoder to a linear distance that we can compare the radial coordinates against. Once the desired coordinate is reached, a flag variable will be sent out to the syringe motor task indicating it is ready for pancake mix to be dispersed.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{FSM?}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
\hypertarget{index_TRANSVERSE}{}\doxysubsection{MOTOR TASK}\label{index_TRANSVERSE}
The transverse motor task will be responsible for the transverse motion of our nozzle. This task will function by taking the transverse coorinates coordinates from the G-\/\+Code task and using these values as reference points for a controller object. The output of the controller object will then be used to apply a duty cycle toi the transverse motor. Since we will be using the encoders to measure position, we need to make sure that the encoder reads degrees and not ticks. Once the desired coordinate is reached, a flag variable will be sent out to the syringe motor task indicating it is ready for pancake mix to be dispersed.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{FSM?}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
\hypertarget{index_SYRINGE}{}\doxysubsection{MOTOR TASK}\label{index_SYRINGE}
The syringe motor task will be responsible for the dispersion of the pancake mixture.
